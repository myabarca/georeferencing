# Combining Legacy Collections Data with Data from Modern Digitization Efforts
 This project began as an attempt to merge collaborative georeference data with their associated collections data. You'll find scripts and documentation for cleaning, combining and mapping georeferenced natural history museum localities and occurrence records. Afterwards, the project focused on integrating our legacy Filemaker database records into a new, open-source MariaDB database. You can find the process and workflow described here as well. You can see an overview of this whole project in the poster presented at the Society for the Preservation of Natural History Collection (SPNHC) 2022 conference. Hopefully this is useful to those of you who are undertaking a similar migration or are trying to combine collections data from different sources to accomplish a task. 
 
 # Contents 
 The checklist folder has a Jupyter notebook with sample csvs for trying a script that creates a new csv with your locationID data that still needs to be georeferenced. 
 
 The map folder has a Jupyter notebook with sample csv for mapping georeferenced data. 
 
 The sql folder has some queries useful for joining georeferencing and locality tables in a MySQL/MariaDB database.
