# MAPPING FROM A REQUEST #
    # Didn't purse this method after all. Went with code above.

# Use requests.get(url) to get the url
# Since data is in JSON, can use .json() to format the response object as a json/dictionary
#response = requests.get('https://native-land.ca/wp-json/nativeland/v1/api/index.php?maps=territories').json()

# Usually would print response.content, but since we added .json(), we can just print response without content method
# print(response)
    
# The result is a list of objects
# Loop through list to isolate the data you're interested in
    
#for data in response:
     #print(data)       # response data is now not in a list of objects, but printed as each item (and each item is a dictionary). Useful for seeing what keys we need to pull from.
#    if data['properties']['Name']:
#        print(data['properties']['Name'])
#    else:
#        continue
